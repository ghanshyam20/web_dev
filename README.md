# 💼 Job Application Form – Web Dev Practice

Hey Juha  👋  
This is a small web development project I made to practice HTML and CSS Grid.  
The idea was to build a **simple and clean job application form** that works nicely on both desktop and mobile screens.

I didn’t use any frameworks — just **pure HTML and CSS** to keep things simple and learn how layouts actually work under the hood.

## ✨ What this project includes

- 🧱 A complete **Job Application Form** with basic input fields  
- 📱 **Responsivene design** – single column on mobile, two columns on desktop  
- 🎨 Styles using **CSS Grid** and a few small design touches  
- ✅ **W3C validation** done for both HTML and CSS (everything passes)  
- 🚀 The form submits data to **Postman Echo**, which just echoes the data back (for demo purposes)
